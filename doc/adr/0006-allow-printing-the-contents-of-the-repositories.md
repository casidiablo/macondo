# 6. Allow printing the contents of the repositories

**Date**: 2020-05-29
**Status**: Proposed

## Context

Now that the repositories are behind a cache (http ones), it might be handy to
see their contents as YAML wihtout having to fetch its content manually

## Decision

Not worth it. It's easy enough to inspect a repository.

## Consequences

Users have to manually retrieve the repositories to see their content.
